                an original vampire character that I made while I was really into twilight. She started as a youtuber joke character, but has evolved into a more nuanced specimen. That glum-looking little angel is her love interest, Mulciber. You can read a little more about their lore and stuff <a href= "https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FtTAEQ7YQGh_-GhoFL6o9qSKfGRV1aUyfy8eN7whVF8/edit?usp=sharing" target = "_blank">here</a>.

                more doctor who fanart (can you tell who my favorite is?) but this time it is nice and colored with copics :)

            <figcaption>
                nothing to see here, just me lamenting about acne as well as life drama. Seriously though, those hydrocolloid band-aids are amazing for zits.
