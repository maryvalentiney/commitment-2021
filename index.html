                an original vampire character that I made while I was really into twilight. She started as a youtuber joke character, but has evolved into a more nuanced specimen. That glum-looking little angel is her love interest, Mulciber. You can read a little more

                nothing to see here, just me lamenting about acne as well as life drama. Seriously though, those hydrocolloid band-aids are amazing for zits.

                here is lilly again, colored this time. The purple girl is my D&D character, Felix. She sometimes goes by a different name but Felix is the one that matters. I go through phases where I'll draw her all the time and then stop for months.

                Here we go! the selfies! I love the way that I draw myself, and in particular that blue pencil is an underrated gem. I have good memories associated with these drawings as well, I drew them when I was with friends a bit ago and we played jackbox games.

                some more blue pencil sketches from the game night, the dog ones are my friend's new dog named Rocco, he is quite sweet and named after an architectural style. I am personally a big fan of this dog because he is mellow and polite, and he has a funny face.

                i draw these circles when i am feeling overwhelmed and need to draw, but have no idea what to draw. As you can see i messed a few of them up, but that's life.
